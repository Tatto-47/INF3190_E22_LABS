    <pre>
        Once upon a time, you were 25
        Walking up the aisle, you made the promise of your life
        Blinked twice and you were 29
        Singing lullabies, and I looked up at you for the first time
        Words fall short but I am sure

        There'll never be anyone like you, you're
        You're strong like your father even when you are scared
        When I was in trouble, you never left me there
        And you love like your mother, like there's nothing to lose
        You're an unsung hero, so I'll sing this song for you
        Woke up, I was 21, and I fell in love

        Remember how I told you that I'd
        Searched the world and I found the girl
        And oh, how she reminds me of you, you're
        Strong like your father even when you are scared
        When I was in trouble, you never left me there
        And you love like your mother, like there's nothing to lose
        You're an unsung hero, so I'll sing this song for you

        For all the times I fell down, you showed me how to stand
        And when we crossed the ocean, you were my safe place to land
        Been on a thousand stages, but when it's all said and done
        I hope I make you proud of, of the man that I've become

        To be strong like my father even when I am scared
        And when someone's in trouble, I'll never leave them there
        And I'll love like my mother, like there's nothing to lose
        You're my unsung hero, and I sing this song for you
